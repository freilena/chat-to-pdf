## How to Test & Compare

### 1. Start with gpt-4o-mini

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
export OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini"
docker compose up -d
```

**Test with your actual PDFs**:
- Upload real documents
- Ask typical questions
- Evaluate answer quality

### 2. Test Same Questions with gpt-4o

```bash
export OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4o"
docker compose restart api
```

**Compare**:
- Is the answer noticeably better?
- Is the improvement worth 12x cost?
- Does mini miss anything important?

### 3. Make Decision Based on Results

**Stick with mini if**:
- ✅ Answers are accurate and complete
- ✅ Users won't notice quality difference
- ✅ Cost matters (high volume)

**Upgrade to gpt-4o if**:
- ⚠️ Mini's answers lack depth
- ⚠️ Complex reasoning is important
- ⚠️ Quality justifies the cost

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Technical Report

**Question**: "What methodology was used in this study?"

**gpt-4o-mini response**:
> "The study used a randomized controlled trial methodology with 500 participants divided into control and experimental groups."

**gpt-4o response**:
> "The study employed a double-blind randomized controlled trial methodology with 500 participants (250 per group), using stratified sampling to ensure demographic balance. The experimental design included a 6-month follow-up period with monthly assessments."

**Verdict**: gpt-4o provides more detail, but mini is sufficient for most users.

---

### Example 2: Simple Q&A

**Question**: "What is the publication date?"

**gpt-4o-mini**: "October 2024"  
**gpt-4o**: "October 2024"

**Verdict**: No difference - mini is perfect here.

---

### Example 3: Complex Analysis

**Question**: "How does the author's argument in section 3 support or contradict the conclusion?"

**gpt-4o-mini**:
> "The argument in section 3 supports the conclusion by presenting evidence that..."

**gpt-4o**:
> "The argument in section 3 primarily supports the conclusion, though there's an interesting tension: while the data shows X, the interpretation leaves room for Y. This nuance strengthens rather than weakens the conclusion because..."

**Verdict**: gpt-4o shows better critical thinking - worth upgrading if this type of query is common.

---

## Cost Scenarios

### Low Volume (< 100 queries/day)

**gpt-4o-mini**: ~$0.60/month  
**gpt-4o**: ~$7.50/month

**Recommendation**: Use gpt-4o if quality matters - the cost difference is negligible at low volume.

---

### Medium Volume (1000 queries/day)

**gpt-4o-mini**: ~$6/month  
**gpt-4o**: ~$75/month

**Recommendation**: Test both. The $69/month difference may be worth it depending on use case.

---

### High Volume (10,000 queries/day)

**gpt-4o-mini**: ~$60/month  
**gpt-4o**: ~$750/month

**Recommendation**: Start with mini. The $690/month savings is significant unless quality is critical.

---

## Hybrid Approach (Advanced)

For best of both worlds, use smart routing:

```python
# Pseudo-code for future enhancement
if is_complex_query(question):
    model = "gpt-4o"  # Use premium for complex tasks
else:
    model = "gpt-4o-mini"  # Use mini for simple tasks
```

**Query complexity indicators**:
- Contains: "compare", "analyze", "evaluate", "implications"
- Multiple documents referenced
- Follow-up to a complex conversation
- User explicitly requests detailed analysis

This could save 80-90% on costs while maintaining quality where it matters.

---

## Current Implementation

The system is configured to use environment variable:

```bash
# In docker-compose.yml
OPENAI_MODEL=${OPENAI_MODEL:-gpt-4o-mini}
```

**Change anytime without code changes**:
```bash
export OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4o"
docker compose restart api
```

---

## Recommendations by Use Case

### Personal Document Chat
→ **gpt-4o-mini** (cost-effective, sufficient quality)

### Business Document Analysis
→ **gpt-4o** (better quality, cost is manageable)

### Legal/Medical Applications
→ **gpt-4-turbo** (maximum accuracy, cost justified by stakes)

### Public-Facing Service (High Volume)
→ **gpt-4o-mini** with option to upgrade (balance cost & quality)

### Research/Academic
→ **Test both**, let users choose in UI

---

## Bottom Line

**Start with gpt-4o-mini**. It's probably sufficient.

Test with real documents and real questions. Upgrade only if you find specific scenarios where quality improvement justifies the cost.

The beauty of the current implementation: **You can switch anytime with zero code changes**.
